      "Audit 1800 Instagram — content strategy, visual identity,\nengagement, posting cadence. What are they doing well?\nWhere are the gaps Cuervo can exploit?",
      "The Instagram tequila community undervalues the potent storytelling\nframeworks defining analog film photography culture\nFilm communities generate consistent engagement through multi-image\ncarousels, rich gear talk, event activations, and authentic peer\neducation—practices largely absent in tequila’s current feed\nThis gap leaves tequila’s premium, heritage-rich content flatter and\nless immersive, missing emotional connection and sustained loyalty\nHarnessing analog culture’s layered narratives, tactile authenticity,\nand community-driven events will transform Cuervo’s Instagram presence\nfrom static showcase to vibrant experience\nTranslating film’s craft mastery and narrative arcs into tequila\nstorytelling, combined with participatory activations, promises to\nignite deeper engagement and trusted brand affinity.",
      "Craft storytelling and immersive posts drive analog\nengagement.\nStatic visuals limit tequila Instagram’s emotional\nresonance.\nAnalog strategies unlock tequila’s engagement\npotential.\nEducation and peer sharing build tequila brand trust."
