Hot chocolate season is here and what better way to heat up by the fire on a cold winter day with the addition of Espolon Añejo? My favorite chocolate comes from my family’s hometown of Valparaiso, Zacatecas Mexico where cacao is charred over open flame on a comal before being ground into a paste with aromatics. This recipe creates a luxurious earthy chocolate beverage with floral notes of vanilla and the essence of citrus which pairs perfectly with oak aged tequila. 
 
Recipe for 4 cups of hot chocolate 
4 Cups milk of choice 
1-2 Round tablets of Mexican chocolate such as Ibarra 
½ Teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 Teaspoon ground ceylon cinnamon aka canela or Mexican cinnamon
4 Long orange peels (about three inches)
4-6 Ounces Espolon Tequila Anejo
Pinch of salt

Process
Pour milk into a medium pot on medium heat and add tablets of chocolate. Once the chocolate is dissolved in the milk add all the other ingredients and let simmer on low heat for about 2 more minutes to combine. Froth with a whisk or wooden molinillo","","241","211","30",""
